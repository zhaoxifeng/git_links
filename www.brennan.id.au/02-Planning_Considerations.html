<br>






Every network system needs some level of planning. If you have decided
that
you are going to install and configure Linux as your main network
server, then you have planned that, simple as it may be its still a
plan. The following information is designed to provide some basic
everyday considerations to expand your new network plan.<br>






<br>






<h2><a name="aup"></a><a href="#top">Your ISP's
Acceptable Use
Policy</a></h2>






Before we install our server and connect our new network onto the
Internet, we must make sure that we are actually allowed to do so.
Believe it or not, but the Internet Service Provider's plan you used to join the Internet may
prevent you from connecting your new system and operating with a server
and extra workstations - the whole intention of this HOWTO.<br>






<br>






How is this so? When you joined your ISP, you would have agreed to use
their systems the way that they planned their networks and user
accounts to be utilised.
All ISPs draft some type of Acceptable Use Policies (AUP) which are
legal
binding contracts between the user and ISP, it lays out what you can
and
can't do with your account.<br>






<br>






Some ISPs do not allow more than one workstation at a time to connect
with a particular plan. Some may block specific TCP and UDP ports in an
attempt to protect their own networking infrastructure and customers,
more so against
hackers and spammers. Some may also do regular scans of their user's
traffic to determine who is in breach of their AUP.<br>






<br>






Always check with your ISPs AUP to be certain that implementing some
type of server based system and extra workstations is allowable,
otherwise you may
find you no longer have an account if you do the wrong thing. Always
check with the ISP if you're ever in doubt, ignorance is not an excuse.<br>






<br>






If implementing this HOWTO is going to breach your ISPs AUP, please do
not proceed with installing the services herein. Alternatively, your
ISP may have another plan which will be more suited to your needs.<br>






<br>






<h2><a name="requirements"></a><a href="#top">Server
Requirements</a></h2>






Now that we are sure we can install servers using our Internet account,
we need to plan how we are going to connect and configure our server.<br>






<br>






A server would typically be described as a networked computer providing
dedicated services and resources to multiple users and clients. That
being said, the key concept to remember is dedicated services. Because
the server is going to provide various full time networked functions,
it really needs to be a dedicated computer running a single Operating
System. This allows its services to be available to authorised users
any
time they are required.<br>






<br>






Each distribution of Linux has an accompanying set of release notes
which states the computing requirements recommended for an installed
system to successfully operate its software. Installation sizes can
range from 800 MB through to around 4 GB just for the operating
system alone, which does not consider any file storage needs for your
users or the size of which applications can grow through normal use
like a networked database application. If you are planning a large
network for many users, you should consider the storage requirements so
your users and applications have sufficient hard drive space.<br>






<br>






Before you install your server and insert it into your network as the
centre of all your systems, consider what applications and services it
will be running at that time, the amount of users connecting, and the
expected workload it would be subjected to. If you have a large scale
network then your systems may be better distributed over several
servers to reduce processor demand on a single computer. It is far more
sensible (and
easier) to use a system that will meet your requirements for the future
than to do a system swap in a few months time.<br>






<br>






This section is not an enticement that you need to purchase the latest
and biggest components on which to base your server, its just to get
you thinking about sustaining your system's capabilities for the future.<br>






<br>






Most small home users can easily get away with the minimum
specifications or even less, and a second hand computer will most
definitely suit their needs.<br>






<br>






<h2><a name="domainname"></a><a href="#top">Internet
Domain Name</a></h2>






To be uniquely distinguished on the Internet we need one important
aspect, an Internet Address. Our Internet (or IP) Address is likened to
an electronic mailing address that computers and network devices use to
find other networked devices on the electronic super highway, this
allows the delivery of our
data.<br>






<br>






That's all well and good for electrical devices, however it is too
difficult for people to remember many Internet sites purely by a
numerical address, so to be uniquely identified and easily located, we
need a Domain Name which best suits the services we offer. A Domain
Name can be linked to our unique Internet address using the Domain Name
System which we will be configuring later in <a href="08-Domain_Name_System_BIND.html">Chapter
8</a><span style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br>






<br>






The DNS system is historically best suited to static IP addresses.
However, with the introduction of Dynamic DNS, its now even easier for
home users to use a Domain Name with a dynamically changing IP
address. This HOWTO provides a section <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
on <a href="05-Broadband_Connectivity.html#ddnsservices">DDNS
services</a>
and the ability to automate any DDNS changes on a dynamic IP account.<br>






<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>






This HOWTO is written with the assumption that you have a registered
Domain Name that will be used to configure your new server. If you need
to register a new domain, then InterNIC maintains this list (<a href="http://www.internic.net/origin.html">http://www.internic.net/origin.html</a>)
of Domain Registrars listed by country. It is recommended that you have
a domain name registered before installation, as it is easier to
configure during the installation rather than post fixing.<br>






<br>






Some Dynamic DNS service providers also offer sub domain names that can
be registered and used for free, the names are similar to
"yourname.no-ip.org" or "yourname.homelinux.org". If you are happy
using a simple sub domain instead of registering (and paying for) your
own domain name, then&nbsp;have a look at some of the services offered
by the Dynamic DNS service providers listed in <a href="05-Broadband_Connectivity.html#ddnsservices">Chapter 5</a>.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>






<br>






We will be using the domain&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">"<span style="font-weight: bold;">example.com</span>"</span>
which is free to be used for documentation and training purposes. You
will need to
substitute that domain for your registered domain where ever you see it
throughout this document.<br>

several domain registrars before

a Domain Name. You will be required

organisation or individual to legally register and use your domain.<br>

<h2><a name="topology"></a><a href="#top">Network
Topology</a></h2>






Networks are interconnected in many different ways depending on the
connection types, devices in use, the speed of a link, or even the
leasing costs of the line. Many organisations have large scale networks
which require much planning and consideration before they are
installed, however the majority of home users will connect to the
Internet using a simple broadband type modem. The Ethernet and USB
modems would be most typical for home users because of their relatively
low cost and ease of use; therefore we will concentrate on their
configuration.<br>






<br>






The two figures below show what the logical topology of how our network
will look like, with the server separating and providing security to
our internal private network, while maintaining an external connection
to our ISP. This is by no means the best design for a network as it
relies on a single system to provide our total security; the server.
Many modems these days come complete with their own pre-installed
firewall and NAT solutions, these are invaluable devices and provide
that extra level of security for your home network. Configuring
security
enabled routers is outside the scope
of this HOWTO as these instructions are detailed in the modems user
manual.<br>

The topology in figure 1 uses a single ethernet device (eth0) for
connecting all
the internal systems to the server, and a single USB modem (ppp0) to dial the
server and pass all its data. Before choosing this setup method you
should ensure your USB modem is supported by Linux or that your modem
has drivers available for you to use.<br>

</span><br>






Similar to figure 1, the topology illustrated in figure 2 shows the
same internal network design with a single ethernet device (eth1).
However there is a second ethernet device (eth0) which allows the
Point-to-Point Protocol connection out through the ethernet modem and
onto your ISP. This is the preferred method for connection as the
connection is less problematic using an ethernet modem, however it does
require two network cards.<br>






<br>


The configurations and application settings used throughout this HOWTO
follow the Ethernet Modem network topology as seen in Figure 2.<br>
